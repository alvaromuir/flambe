## flambé is where food lovers share.

flambé is a social photo sharing site for lovers of foods - from executive chefs, to line cooks to culinary students to home grillers and even food prop photographers.

The project is divided into two NodeJS powered projects - a Node/Express/CoffeScript/MongoDB stack backend and a Node/FireShell/Grunt/Jade powered ui environment for front-end development

Please see individual README's in each resepctive directory for more info.
